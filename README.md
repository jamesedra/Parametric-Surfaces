## Description
This is a short graphics exercise for studying the Unity engine, shader graph, and optimizing resolution through compute shaders.

## Installation and Usage
1. Download and extract the .zip file from the release tab.
2. Run the .exe file to launch the application.

## Features
- Mathematical Surfaces: Included a variety of mathematical surfaces.

- Adjustable Resolution: The number of cubes in a surface can be adjusted up to a million cubes.

- Spatial Position Coloring: Each cube's color is determined by their world coordinates implemented through a surface shader graph.
- UI Implementation: Users can edit the resolution, the current mathematical surface, cycle, and duration in the build instead of using the inspector window in the editor.

## Getting Started
To use in the Unity Editor:
1. Download the source code in the release tab
2. Click _Add project from disk_ in Unity Hub

## Acknowledgment
This project is built and expanded upon Catlike Coding's Mathematical Surfaces and Compute Shaders. Additions include the incorporation of extra parametric surfaces and the implementation of a user interface for the build.
